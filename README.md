# Fault_Tolerant_System_Design
TMR is a fault-tolerant approach that uses a majority function to take the most repeated objects. The .csv files in the TMR directory are the same and considered as students scores. 
The mid_fault_05.py is a python code to use TMR for choosing between .csv files, then to add them sort the scores.

The Monte Carlo Method directory contains a python program to measure the fault chance and energy consumption of two checkpointing benchmarks.
